**Insurance Cost Prediction**

**Problem Statement**

Insurance companies need to accurately predict the cost of health insurance for individuals to
set premiums appropriately. However, traditional methods of cost prediction often rely on broad
actuarial tables and historical averages, which may not account for the nuanced differences
among individuals. By leveraging machine learning techniques, insurers can predict more
accurately the insurance costs tailored to individual profiles, leading to more competitive pricing
and better risk management.


**Introduction**

Insurance cost prediction is vital for risk management and fair premium pricing. This case study analyzes key factors affecting insurance premiums and evaluates machine learning models to identify the best predictor.

**Dataset Overview**
  
  - Demographics: Age, BMI, etc.
  - Health Indicators: Diabetes, Blood Pressure Problems, Chronic Diseases.
  - Medical History: Surgeries, Allergies, Family Cancer History.
  - Records: 1,338 entries with no missing values.

**Key Insights from EDA**

  - Age & Premium: Premiums increase significantly with age.
  - Health Factors: Diabetes, blood pressure issues, and surgeries contribute to higher costs.
  - BMI Influence: Categorized as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese to refine predictions.

**Recommendations**

 - Use XGBoost for production deployment.
 - Focus on key features like age, BMI, and health indicators.
 - Regular model updates to adapt to new data. 
 - Encourage preventive healthcare to lower overall insurance costs.

**Conclusion**

This study demonstrates how machine learning improves insurance cost prediction. A structured approach to data processing, feature engineering, and model evaluation ensures accuracy and efficiency, benefiting both insurers and policyholders.
